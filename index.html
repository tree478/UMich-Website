    <h1>University of Michigan</h1>

    <p>The University of Michigan, founded in 1817, is the oldest in Michigan. It is a public research university 
        located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. UMich is one of America's earliest research universities and was a founding 
        member of the Association of American Universities. Being a highly prestigious university, it is ranked second 
        best in research and has consistently ranked among the top universities in the US.</p>

    <h3>Why is UMich the Best College To Go To?</h3>

    <p>If you want to go to an Ivy League college but don’t have the money or don’t think you will get in, 
    the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> is the perfect university for you! It is cheaper than Ivy League colleges and 
    has a higher acceptance rate, but it is just as great. It has an excellent athletic program if you are an 
    athlete. If you're looking to go into medicine, engineering, or software, UMich has extraordinary programs
    for that too! It also has a very diverse student body, meaning that you will never have to worry about 
    not finding people with similar interests and backgrounds! UMich is also one of the wealthier schools in 
    America, which not only means you get bragging rights, but if you are a research major, this also means 
    there are no financial limits to what you can research!</p>
    <p>The academic aspect of UMich is incredible and opens a whole new world of possibilities for what you can 
    do in the future! What's more important is the lifestyle. UMich takes great pride in its campus life and 
    makes sure that everyone has access to everything they need to be physically, emotionally, and mentally 
    healthy. There are multiple socializing areas around the campus where you can chill and hang out with 
    friends. Additionally, Michigan Dining provides a large variety of food for your diet, providing students 
    with on-campus cafes, markets, and dining halls. And even better, UMich started a program called the 
    Maiz and Blue Cupboard, through which you can get an MCard, which makes everything related to food free 
    to buy!</p>
    <p>UMich also goes to strenuous efforts to provide its students with good housing options. The campus 
    contains 18 residence halls with 1480 apartments that can accommodate undergrads, grads, and students 
    with families. For those of you looking for off-campus housing options,  there is a Beyond the Diagram 
    program, where you can find resources and student ambassadors who can connect you with different options.</p>
